subtitle: A little history about my experience and why data science
---


I started my career in the private equity industry, where I worked for a leading private equity real estate investment manager, Bridge Investment Group. While there I learned a lot about the alternative investment industry and how much I enjoyed the challenges and the problem solving that went along with working in that field. Later I moved over to a fast growing and fast pace fund administration company, Strata Fund Solutions. There I worked with investment managers in the reale estate private equity and the traditional private equity strategies. My experience in accounting and finance in the alternative investment industry has led me to see a spot for data science to add a lot of value. Its a growing field and one that I have seen that is not highly leveraged by those that I have worked for, but one in which they all would like to expand. I am excited about the potential to learn more about data science and how I can add value in the financial and accounting industries!
